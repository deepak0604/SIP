# SIP
Shopping Intention
Online shopping is very common in today’s scenario. Before making a buy decision, a typical user visits multiple sites, and compare prices of similar item from different sites. 
Based on certain models and data gathered during user session, this project would determine whether a user who is visiting shopping website like Amazon, Kohl’s, Best Buy etc would indeed buy a product or not. The project would consider various parameters before predicting visitor’s shopping behavior.
The shopping website pages are categorized based on product types. 
Some of the important parameters to consider are, the number of different types of pages visited by the visitor in each session; the total time spent on each of the categorized pages; the user information (gender, location, and neighborhood). 
These parameters will be used to make prediction regarding shopping behavior of the user. 
To summarize, the objective of the SIP project is to determine viability of precise and scalable purchasing intention prediction for e-commerce sites using clickstream and session information data.
